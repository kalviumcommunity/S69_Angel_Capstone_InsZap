## Project Overview: Universal EV charging platform for India

### Introduction:

Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption in India is growing rapidly, but the fragmented nature of charging infrastructure creates a major inconvenience for EV users. Different networks operate their own apps, making it cumbersome to locate, access, and pay for charging across different providers. Our capstone project aims to solve this problem by creating a universal EV charging platform that aggregates all charging stations, regardless of network, into a single web-based Progressive Web App (PWA).

This platform will provide real-time information on charger availability, support multiple payment methods, and use AI-driven recommendations for route optimization and charging station suggestions. The goal is to simplify the EV charging experience and make it seamless and efficient.

## Key Features
Aggregator Model: The platform will act as a central hub, pulling data from multiple charging networks via APIs.
Real-Time Availability: Users will see the live status of charging stations (occupied, available, or faulty).
Payment Integration: Support for UPI, digital wallets, and credit/debit cards for seamless transactions.
Location-Based Services: GPS integration to guide users to the nearest compatible charging station.
AI-Driven Recommendations: Personalized charging suggestions based on usage history, traffic conditions, and battery level.
Route Planning: Optimized stop suggestions based on current battery status and charger availability.
User Reviews & Ratings: Crowdsourced feedback to help users choose the best stations.
Standardized Compatibility: Support for all major charger types (CCS, CHAdeMO, Type 2, Bharat DC001).
Web + PWA Approach: Accessible on any device with offline functionality and push notifications.

## Challenges & Solutions

Different Charging Networks & Protocols:
API integrations with major charging networks.
Collaboration with government-backed aggregators like the National Electric Mobility Mission.
Standardization of Charging Protocols:
Universal front-end displaying compatible chargers based on the EV model.
Real-Time Data & Availability:
Use of real-time APIs and crowdsourced user updates.
Payment Integration Across Providers:
Unified payment system for various gateways and subscription models.
Regulatory & Business Cooperation:
Start with open networks and gradually onboard private providers.

## Conclusion

This universal EV charging platform will significantly enhance the EV ownership experience in India by eliminating the need for multiple apps and offering a seamless, efficient charging process. By integrating real-time availability, AI-driven recommendations, and a wide range of payment options, the platform aims to become the go-to solution for all EV users. The web-based PWA approach ensures accessibility across devices with minimal friction, and the scalability potential makes it a promising project for future expansion. Starting with one city as an MVP, the platform can gradually expand nationwide, providing a unified solution for India's growing EV ecosystem.
